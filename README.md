# Motion Insensitive Silent Neuroimaging with MERLIN
Code to accompany paper on MERLIN recently submitted.

- Figures 1, 4, SI.1, and SI.2 can be reproduced using the Jupyter notebooks found in the notebooks folder.
- Due to privacy reasons we are not able to share a full in vivo dataset for demonstrating the MERLIN workflow. As a substitute, we provide a demo using a simulated Shepp Logan phantom with motion which uses the same motion correction framework as the in vivo data. See the demo folder.
