Shepp Logan MOCO Demo
=======================

This is a simple demo to demonstrate the pymerlin motion correction framework using simulated data. Requires riesling and pymerling to be installed and in your path. The performance of this demo is not optimal, partly due to the symetric shape of the Shepp Logan phantom, it is purely meant to give a demo for how to use the tools and how to adapt your own data to be used with pymerlin.

To run the demo, execute the shell script

.. code:: shell

    $ bash run_demo.sh
